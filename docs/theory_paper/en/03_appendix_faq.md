# Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

###### Q: In my region, the government may use torture on detainees to extract passwords or wallet mnemonic phrases. Is there any way to counter this?

A: I can only share a small piece of experience from that of a dissident:  
- If you have 10 seconds before being arrested, throw your phone or hardware key into the microwave.  
- If your system is installed on an SD card, in an emergency, throw the SD card into your mouth and chew it up (without swallowing).  
- [Trezor supports using an SD card](https://trezor.io/learn/a/encrypt-pin-with-microsd-card) as an alternative passphrase; when not in use, the SD card can be removed and placed on a dedicated necklace, and in a critical moment, it can be chewed up.

###### Q: I am worried that the Trezor I purchased might have a backdoor.

A: Based on open‑source information and online tutorials, you can DIY your own Trezor and use a passphrase.

###### Q: How can you guarantee that OnionVault has no security vulnerabilities?

A: We encourage everyone in the community to audit the code and work to fix any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible based on audit results. We also commit to alerting as many users as possible to take appropriate temporary measures upon receiving security vulnerability reports. In short, we will do our utmost—we will not be less secure than other password managers.
